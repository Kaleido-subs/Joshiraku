Dialogue: 10,0:07:00.90,0:07:07.16,Default,,0,0,0,,But if everyone went to the party wearing what they normally do,

Dialogue: 10,0:07:32.18,0:07:35.02,Default,,0,0,0,,I don't think casual wear would mean to come in your work clothes.
Dialogue: 10,0:07:35.02,0:07:36.56,Default,,0,0,0,,It could mean plain clothes,
Dialogue: 10,0:07:36.56,0:07:38.40,Default,,0,0,0,,but I wear something different every day.
Dialogue: 10,0:07:38.85,0:07:44.01,Default,,0,0,0,,Then shouldn't casual wear be something that you make sure to wear every day?
Dialogue: 10,0:07:44.01,0:07:44.86,Default,,0,0,0,,That's it!
Dialogue: 10,0:07:54.45,0:07:56.66,Default,,0,0,0,,Pajamas are casual wear?

Dialogue: 10,0:08:06.63,0:08:10.64,Default,,0,0,0,,It's like a status symbol amongst the elite who live near the city center.
Dialogue: 10,0:08:10.64,0:08:15.73,Default,,0,0,0,,But they banned that around the time of the Olympics, citing that it was bad manners.
Dialogue: 10,0:08:15.73,0:08:18.64,Default,,0,0,0,,Anyway, pajamas are definitely the king of casual wear!
Dialogue: 10,0:08:18.64,0:08:24.61,Default,,0,0,0,,So saying "dress casually" is actually an invitation to a pajama party?
Dialogue: 10,0:08:24.94,0:08:26.86,Default,,0,0,0,,That's so dirty.
Dialogue: 10,0:08:26.86,0:08:28.57,Default,,0,0,0,,I still don't think that's right.

Dialogue: 10,0:08:47.72,0:08:49.09,Default,,0,0,0,,That's not "wear" at all!
Dialogue: 10,0:08:49.09,0:08:54.97,Default,,0,0,0,,So saying "dress casually" is actually an invitation to a nude party?
