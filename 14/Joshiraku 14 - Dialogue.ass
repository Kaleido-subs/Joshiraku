According to Jisho, a 25% acceptance rate would be a rating of 4, so I assume a rating of 916 would be an acceptance rate of 1/916 = ~0.11%. Furthermore, the acceptance rate of 916 appears to be related to AKB and the aforementioned Atsuko Maeda. Apparently there were 250 tickets for her graduation and 229096 entrants in the raffle, which is a 1 in 916 chance of winning a ticket: 38 times the normal rate.
